# Introduction
## About Auto-Metadata Generator
Depositar is an online repository dedicated to housing research data curated by Academia Sinica, Taiwan. As is the case with any data repository, the role of metadata cannot be understated—it serves as the cornerstone when users embark on the quest to discover datasets that align with their specific requirements.

Nonetheless, the task of accurately and comprehensively filling in metadata remains a formidable challenge for dataset providers. When users upload their datasets, they often find themselves uncertain about which Wikidata keywords would best suit their content. Moreover, grappling with the intricacies of spatial coverage can be a considerably intricate endeavor.

Thus, this project aims to develop a metadata generator. Based on textual dataset information such as descriptions or source file names, this program will automatically recommend to users certain Wikidata keywords and spatial coverage information that will assist them in completing the metadata for their dataset.

```{admonition} TL;DR
* **input:** dataset title, dataset description, filenames of sources, file description of sources, project name, project description
* **output:** wikidata keywords and spatial information for the uploaded dataset
